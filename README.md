# Universal Maintenance Assistant (UMA)
*A ruggedized, all-in-one diagnostics and technical reference system.*

---

## Overview
The **Universal Maintenance Assistant (UMA)** is a concept for a portable, self-contained system designed for IT and field technicians.  
Its goal is to combine **diagnostic tools**, **technical publications**, and **maintenance logging** into a single device — inspired by military and aerospace IETM systems and rugged laptops like the Panasonic Toughbook.

---

## Project Goals
- Develop a **portable diagnostics suite** capable of interfacing with computers, printers, and other networked devices.  
- Create a **digital technical library** to store and access service manuals, wiring diagrams, and maintenance references.  
- Build a **local logging or ticketing interface** for recording maintenance actions and after-action reports.  
- Design the system to function **fully offline**, ideal for field conditions or secure environments.

---

## Target Hardware
Initial prototype options:
- **Raspberry Pi 5** (8GB)
  - Portable and modular
  - Large community support
- **Refurbished rugged laptop (Panasonic Toughbook, Dell Latitude Rugged, etc.)**
  - Built-in durability and screen
  - Expandable storage for technical manuals

### Hardware Components (Concept)
| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Mainboard | Raspberry Pi 5 or small form factor PC |
| Storage | 512GB–1TB SSD (for manuals + software) |
| Display | 7–10" touchscreen or Toughbook display |
| Power | USB-C PD power bank or PiJuice HAT |
| Connectivity | Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth, optional Ethernet or LTE |
| I/O | USB hub for adapters, serial ports, or OBD-II interface |

---

## Software Stack (Planned)
| Function | Software / Tool |
|-----------|----------------|
| Operating System | Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu, or Kali Linux |
| Diagnostics | `inxi`, `hardinfo`, `smartmontools`, `lshw`, manufacturer utilities |
| Printer Tools | SNMP walk, CUPS logs, JetAdmin, EpsonNet |
| Network Tools | `nmap`, `iperf3`, `wireshark`, `netcat` |
| Library Management | Calibre, Zotero, or local Kiwix/MediaWiki instance |
| PDF/Manual Viewer | PDF.js or Evince |
| Ticketing/Logging | SQLite-based local log or lightweight web dashboard |
| Optional Interface | Flask or Node.js web UI for system access |

---

## Example Workflow
1. Connect the UMA to a system via USB or network.  
2. Run automated diagnostic scripts to gather error codes, SMART data, or hardware health reports.  
3. The system identifies the device (e.g., “Dell Optiplex 7060”) and retrieves the corresponding service manual.  
4. The technician performs maintenance using on-screen instructions.  
5. Results and actions are logged locally for record-keeping.

---

## Future Features
- QR or barcode scanning to auto-load device info or manuals  
- AI-assisted troubleshooting suggestions (local model or offline lookup)  
- Cloud sync or Git integration for shared documentation  
- Support for embedded microcontrollers or vehicle systems (OBD-II)

## Project Status
> **Current Phase:** Concept & Design  
> No hardware purchased yet. Planning stage due to budget constraints.  
> Focus: defining specifications, organizing manuals, and researching diagnostic tools.

---

## Notes
This project originated from the idea of combining:
- A **portable diagnostics computer**
- A **digital technical manual library**
- A **personal field maintenance assistant**

All concepts are developed with cost efficiency and real-world IT applicability in mind.
