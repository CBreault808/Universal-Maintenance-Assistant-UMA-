# After-Action Report: Diagnostic Network Setup

**Date:** 2025-10-05  
**Author:** Chris Breault  
**Project:** Universal Diagnostic System Prototype  
**Environment:** Proxmox VE  

---

## 1. Objective

Establish a secure, isolated virtual network to serve as a sandbox for developing and testing a universal diagnostic platform.  
The setup simulates real-world IT maintenance conditions, allowing diagnostic tools and scripts to run on a “target” system from a separate “test” system.

---

## 2. Systems Overview

| VM Name | Role | OS | Network | IP Address |
|----------|------|----|----------|-------------|
| **UbuntuTest** | Diagnostic Host (control node) | Ubuntu Desktop (Minimal Install) | vmbr1 (Isolated) | 192.168.100.10 |
| **UbuntuTarget** | Simulated End-User System | Ubuntu Desktop (Full Install) | vmbr1 (Isolated) | 192.168.100.11 |

---

## 3. Actions Taken

1. **Provisioned Two VMs** in Proxmox for a controlled diagnostic environment.
2. **Installed Core Tools** on `UbuntuTest` for system information and diagnostics:
   - `lshw`, `lscpu`, `hwinfo`, `smartmontools`, `memtester`, `stress-ng`, `sysstat`, and others.
3. **Configured Static IPs** for both systems using NetworkManager GUI:
   - Chose the private subnet `192.168.100.0/24`.
   - Assigned placeholder gateway `192.168.100.1`.
4. **Tested Network Connectivity** using ICMP (`ping`) in both directions.
5. **Verified Communication** remained functional after moving both VMs to the isolated Proxmox bridge (`vmbr1`).

## 4. Results

- Successful two-way communication between isolated systems.  
- Confirmed that diagnostic operations can run without internet dependency.  
- Established foundation for remote diagnostic scripting and data collection via SSH.

---

## 5. Lessons Learned

- Using an internal bridge (`vmbr1`) is an effective way to isolate experimental systems without risking main network interference.
- Assigning static IPs simplifies long-term management and remote operations.
- Even in isolated environments, defining a “dummy” gateway and DNS ensures tool compatibility.

---

## 6. Next Steps

1. Enable **SSH-based access** from UbuntuTest → UbuntuTarget.
2. Develop and test an initial **Bash diagnostic script** to:
   - Gather system information.
   - Detect basic hardware or performance issues.
   - Correlate findings with stored maintenance manuals.
3. Integrate the script’s outputs into log files for automated reporting.

## 7. Remarks

This marks the successful completion of the **Diagnostic Network Phase** of the Universal Diagnostic System project.  
The setup represents a scalable and professional foundation for ongoing experimentation with system health monitoring, automation, and technical publication integration.
